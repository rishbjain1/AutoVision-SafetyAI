# AutoVision-SafetyAI 🚗🤖⚠️

AI project combining **object detection** and **data science analysis** to improve road safety and evaluate autopilot technology.  

This project is divided into two objectives:  

---

## 📌 Objectives

**Part 1: Vehicle Detection (Computer Vision)**  
- Develop a CNN-based object detection model to:  
  - Predict the type of vehicle in an image  
  - Localize vehicles using rectangular bounding boxes  
- Train, evaluate, and run inference on test images to validate accuracy  

**Part 2: Autopilot & Road Safety Analysis (Data Science)**  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on accident datasets  
- Study the effect of Tesla Autopilot usage on road safety  
- Key focus areas:  
  - Number of victims in accidents  
  - Frequency of Tesla collisions with pedestrians/cyclists  
  - Proportion of events with fatalities among Tesla occupants  
  - Verified Tesla Autopilot-related deaths  
  - Distribution of events across vehicle models and years
